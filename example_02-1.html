      <h2>What Acrylic Pouring is and how to get started</h2>
      <img src ="picture01.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring" width ="400">
      <p>Crafting should be fun – and if there’s one craft that ticks all the boxes for being enjoyable, satisfying, creative 
         and lots of fun, it’s acrylic pouring.
      </p>
	  
      <p>Not only are the results incredible, acrylic pouring is an ideal beginner’s craft; you don’t need any prior experience 
         of doing other crafts and even though is uses paints, you don’t need to have tried acrylic painting before.
      </p>
	  
      <p>Best of all, there are no mistakes in acrylic paint pouring – whatever design you make, it will be a unique piece of art 
         for your home. Fancy giving it a go? Keep reading for our acrylic pouring guide where we explain what is it, what you 
         need to do it, acrylic pouring techniques and the best acrylic paint pouring kits to get you started.

      <h2>What is acrylic pouring?</h2>
      <img src ="picture02.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring" width ="400">
      <p>Acrylic pouring is also known as fluid art and liquid art. It’s a form of art that involves mixing different acrylic paint 
         colours with a pouring medium and then pouring the paint directly on to a canvas without a brush. You then gently move the 
         paint around by tilting the canvas in different directions to change the direction of where the paint flows.
      </p>
	  <p>This creates an abstract, one-of-a-kind, psychedelic, marbled painting where the colours merge and blend – it’s extremely 
             satisfying and looks beautiful. Your artwork will dry with a high-gloss finish creating canvas art that will look 
             extraordinary hung on your walls and makes an impressive handmade gift.
      </p>	  

      <h2>What you need for acrylic pouring</h2>
      <img src ="picture03.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring" width ="400">	  
      <p>The main consideration for acrylic pouring is having enough space to do it – as when it come swirling the colours around on your canvas you’ll need to be able to move your arms, and of course all surfaces should be covered in case of falling paint drops.
      </p>

      <p>When it comes to acrylic pouring tools and materials, you’ll need:
      </p>
	  
	  <h2>Acrylic paint and medium or pre-mixed pouring paints</h2>
	  <img src ="picture04.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Medium" width ="345">
	  <img src ="picture06.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Brush" width ="450">
	  <img src ="picture08.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Brush" width ="275">	  
	  <p>You can use any acrylic paint you already have at home that comes in a bottle or tube but you’ll need to mix it with a medium like Liquitex Professional Pouring Medium this will make your paints more fluid so they pour smoothly. Some artists use PVA glue instead of a professional medium and this is something you could try. Or, you can purchase pre-mixed paints ready made for pouring to make the process quicker and easier.
      </p>
	  
	  <h2>Canvas</h2>
	  <img src ="picture07.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="375">	  
	  <p>This will become your finished artwork – you don’t need to stick to an ordinary rectangle canvas, there are many options of shapes available but aim for a deep edge canvas as these are easier to hold when you tilt and pour.
      </p>
	  
	  <h2>Plastic cups</h2>	
	  <img src ="picture09.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="400">
	  <img src ="picture10.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="400">	  
	  <p>This is for pouring the paints. You’ll transfer the paint into the cups and then pour the paints directly into the canvas. You could also try a split cup.
      </p>
	  
	  <h2>Plastic sheeting</h2>		  
	  <p>Cover your floor, table and any other surfaces that you don’t want paint to drip on.
      </p>
	 
	  <h2>Palette knife or spatula</h2>
	  <img src ="picture11.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="370">	
	  <img src ="picture12.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="400">		  
	  <p>This is required for when you’re mixing your paint and medium together to ensure you get a smooth blend.
      </p>
	  
	  <h2>Latex gloves</h2>		  
	  <p>Paint and pouring is a messy combination! Wearing gloves also allow you to touch your artwork so you can 
             physically move paint with your fingers for an interesting effect.
      </p>
	  
	  <h2>Silicone Oil (optional)</h2>
	  <img src ="picture13.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="400">		  
	  <p>Adding a few drops of silicone oil into your acrylic paint mixture will give your finished art work a high-
             shone gloss making the colours pop. Purchase from an art store not a hardware store, as those brands can be 
             too strong and sometimes toxic.
      </p>

      <h2>How to make acrylic pouring paint</h2>
      <img src ="picture14.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="400">		  
      <p>When you’re making paint for acrylic pouring, use bottled acrylic paints or those that come in large tubes, 
         not the heavy acrylics that come in small tubes, as these are too thick. The average ratio for mixing fluid 
         paint with medium is 1:1 where it’s one part paint, one part medium plus two to three drops of silicone oil 
         for every colour that you’re mixing.
      <br>
         However the ratio may change depending on the brand of paint you use so be flexible with measurements. As long 
         as it pours smoothly and quickly you’ll have the right consistency you need.
      </p>

      <p>To prepare your paint mixes, first pour your chosen paint into a cup. Then gently add your medium, mix it with 
         the palette knife to form a smooth pourable mixture a bit like a runny honey. Add your drops of silicone oil if 
         you’re using it.
      </p>
	  
	  <h2>How to do acrylic paint pouring techniques</h2>
	  <img src ="picture15.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="400">	  
	  <p>Cover your surfaces, lay your canvas down on the table and have your pouring paints ready in cups next to you. 
             Don’t forget to wear your gloves. It’s then time to get pouring on the canvas surface. There are different ways 
             to pour paint and over time with more experience, you’ll know exactly when to lift the cup to limit colours and 
             control designs and patterns. We’ve highlighted some of the most common techniques in these step-by-step videos:
      </p>
	 
      <h2>Puddle pour</h2>
      <img src ="picture16.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="400">
      <img src ="picture16-1.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="420">	  
      <p>A puddle pour, also called a straight pour, is when you add individual colours to the centre of your canvas and then 
           build up layers as you go. Manipulate the paints by tilting the canvas to different angles, and create different 
           effects by swiping the paint with a palette knife. You can also do a wash pour with this technique, which means using 
           quite thin paint to create a feathery effect.
      </p>
	  
      <h2>Dirty pour</h2>	
      <img src ="picture17.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="400">
      <img src ="picture17-1.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="370">
      <img src ="picture17-2.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="420">	  
      <p>With the dirty pour technique, all your colours are placed into a plastic cup before pouring. The consistency of your 
         paint here is key because if it's too runny the colours will blend together in the cup and appear muddy on the canvas.
      </p>
	  
      <p>Once you've poured the cup of paint onto the canvas, tilt it at different angles until the surface is covered.
      </p>
	  
      <p>Dirty pours are great for experimenting with colour and finishes as you never really know how they will come out.
      </p>
	  
      <h2>Flip cup</h2>	
      <img src ="picture18.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="330">
      <img src ="picture18-1.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="330">
      <img src ="picture18-2.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="330">	  
      <p>This technique starts off identical to dirty pouring, but the container with the paint in it is put on the painting 
         surface vertically and then lifted up (as opposed to 'pouring' from a height.)
      </p>
	  
      <h2>Bottle bottom puddle pour</h2>
      <img src ="picture19.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="300">
      <img src ="picture19-1.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="330">
      <img src ="picture19-2.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="340">
      <img src ="picture19-3.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="320">	  
      <p>The bottle bottom pour is where the base of a plastic bottle is placed in the centre of the canvas and you pour individual 
         colours on top.
      </p>
	  
      <p>The raised shape of the bottle base will create a flower pattern effect once enough paint is applied to cover the entire surface.
      </p>
	  
      <p>At the end, you can take a fine artist brush and add accents where desired to highlight the flower effect further. And, 
         if you're feeling really arty, you can use more than one bottle bottom for multiple floral patterns.
      </p>
	  
      <h2>Funnel pour</h2>	
      <img src ="picture20.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="300">
      <img src ="picture20-1.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="285">
      <img src ="picture20-2.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="280">
      <img src ="picture20-3.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="410">	  
      <p>This is great if you're just starting out with acrylic pouring. Simply pour three or four colours into a funnel while keeping 
         your finger over the opening. When you are ready to go, remove your finger and let the paint pour through the funnel onto the 
         canvas. You may see people using heat products but you can skip this step if you want to keep it simple.
      </p>
	  
      <h2>Leaving your artwork to dry</h2>
      <img src ="picture21.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="400">
      <img src ="picture21-1.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="300">
      <img src ="picture21-2.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="385">
      <img src ="picture21-3.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="370">
      <br>
      <img src ="picture21-4.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="410">
      <img src ="picture21-5.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="375">
      <img src ="picture21-6.png" alt="Acrylic Pouring Canvas" width ="410">	  
      <p>It can take anything from 24 to 72 hours for acrylic pouring to dry so you’ll need to have a space ready where you can transfer 
         your canvas and leave it there to dry without being disturbed. This needs to be a flat surface otherwise paint may gather and 
         pool in particular areas that you may not want. To avoid dust falling on your creation you could place a large cardboard box 
         over it.
      </p>
	  
      <p>Allow it to dry naturally. Avoid artificial dryers, such as hairdryers, as these may only set the top surface and not the 
         paint underneath.
      </p>
	  
      <p>Acrylic paint pouring is a satisfying, mindful craft where you can really explore the benefits of colour therapy, seeing 
         how colours are created and merge together is magical.
      </p>
	  
      <p>If the craft sounds like one you’d like to test out without buying all the materials, then why not buy a paint pouring kit? 
         They are a wonderful way to try the craft and see if you like it, though we think once you’ve got started acrylic pouring, you 
         won’t want to stop!
